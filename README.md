## Etch-A-Sketch
In this project I have attempted to recreate an Etch-A-Sketch with a slight twist.

### Black And White
This part of the project features a sketchpad which, when hovered over, each block turns into a darker shade of grey until completely black.

### Colors
The second part of the project features the same sketchpad however, when hovered over, each block turns into a randomly generated RGB color.
